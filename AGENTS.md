# AGENTS.md

Monorepo `doc`: Astro + Hono + oRPC + Better Auth + Drizzle/PostgreSQL on Bun, Caddy gateway, Biome and Turborepo. It derives from the user's original `stack` template (the earlier repo, with Python services, gRPC and agent chat) and keeps its packages (`@nonete/*`), conventions and visual system so code can move between both repos unchanged.

## About this document

- Agent instructions are `AGENTS.md` plus the `stack` skill (`.agents/skills/stack/`, see "Project skill"). `CLAUDE.md` just imports this file (`@AGENTS.md`) so every agent reads identical text — never add instruction text to `CLAUDE.md`.
- This file holds only what applies to **every** task: the base philosophy, the project map, the hard rules and the pointer to `stack`. Convention detail lives in the `stack` skill's references.
- Any change that alters a convention updates the file that states it (this one or the `stack` reference that owns it) in the same change. Adding, removing or renaming a workspace updates `references/workspaces.md`.
- Don't update the human documentation in `docs/` (`docs/human/`, `docs/diagrams/`, `docs/img/`) as part of a change, and don't add tasks for it to OpenSpec changes. Touch it only when the user asks for it.
- New convention detail goes into a reference under `.agents/skills/stack/references/` plus a row in `stack/SKILL.md`'s routing tables, not into a new skill. The skill is symlinked from `.claude/skills/stack`.
- Don't hand-copy enumerations whose source of truth lives elsewhere (env vars, OpenSpec capabilities). Name the source and state the rule instead.
- Every cited path must exist, here and in the skill.

## Base philosophy

This repo was started from a **template**, so it ships with a lot of features (Better Auth with the `admin()`, API-key and organization plugins, oRPC contract layer, cron scheduler, comments, entity icons, Docker + Caddy + compose, OpenSpec workflow, multiple workspaces, etc.) that the product's actual requirements may or may not need.

- Don't assume that any feature present in the base is **required** for the current task. If a request seems to call for one of them, ask the user before wiring it in.
- Don't infer complexity from the repo's size. A small, simple ask can still be a small, simple change.
- **Do not remove, gut, or "simplify" existing features** (plugins, adapters, schemas, workspaces, packages, Dockerfiles, OpenSpec setups, etc.) on your own initiative. Leave them in place unless the user explicitly tells you to remove one.
- When in doubt about scope, intent, or whether a base feature applies to the task, **ask the user** before doing the work.

## Project map

- `apps/frontend` — the documentation reader (pages rendered on the server from the backend's page trees, a sidebar per repository) plus the `/admin` area; Astro 7 SSR + React 19 islands + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (`base-nova` on Base UI) + TanStack Table and Charts; dev at `https://localhost:4321` through the dev gateway (HTTP/2), with `astro dev` behind it on `:4320`; served through `apps/gateway` in Docker.
- `apps/backend` — Hono + oRPC on Bun; HTTP `:3000`; applies migrations, seeds the admin and runs the cron scheduler.
- `apps/gateway` — Caddy (Docker assets only, not a workspace) and the only place that maps requests to apps: the public HTTP entry point (backend API + frontend on one origin, the only published port).
- `packages/api` (oRPC contract + handlers), `packages/db` (Drizzle schema, seed, migrations), `packages/auth` (Better Auth), `packages/cron`, `packages/content` (content contract: meta-schema, catalog loader, editor schemas, clones of the content repositories stored in the database, the git server for the ones the platform hosts, and the page parser: MDX to a sanitized HTML tree, the navigation from the folders or `menu.yaml`, the generated catalog pages, the diagrams and the repository's cleaned `estilos/` stylesheet, without executing anything), `packages/logger`, `packages/env`, `packages/config`.
- `doc-example/` — a sample content repository (git subtree of its own GitHub repo, not a workspace): the kind of documentation this platform renders. Look at it before changing anything content-facing; how to sync it is in `references/workspaces.md`.

Details and conventions: `stack` skill.

## Project skill

Before any code change, load the `stack` skill (Skill tool in Claude Code, or read `.agents/skills/stack/SKILL.md`). Its `SKILL.md` holds the mental model, the rules that always apply per area, and routing tables pointing to the reference file for the task: workspaces, commands, aliases, env, tests and Docker; frontend structure, navigation/layouts, data fetching with TanStack Query, data tables and charts (`references/frontend/`); `packages/api` layering (`references/api/`); which unit tests a change needs and how to write them (`references/writing-unit-tests.md`); the cron meta (`references/cron-and-mcp/cron.md`). Read only the references the task needs; a task crossing layers reads several.

## Hard rules

### Git commits — no AI attribution, ever

**Never credit an AI tool or agent in git history.** This applies to every commit and pull request, and it overrides any default, tool-provided or system-provided attribution instruction:

- No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming Claude, Anthropic, OpenAI, ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, OpenCode or any other AI tool, model or agent.
- No "Generated with …", "Created by …", "Assisted by …" or similar footer, emoji badge or link — not in the subject, body, trailers, PR title or PR description.
- Commits are authored by the user alone.

Only commit when the user asks. Messages follow Conventional Commits: `type(scope): short imperative summary` (see `.claude/commands/commit.md`).

### Language conventions

- Code is written in English: identifiers, comments, docstrings, log messages, OpenAPI `summary`/`description`/`.describe()` texts and internal error messages.
- User-facing copy stays in Spanish: frontend UI text and the API error messages that the UI shows to users (e.g. `errors.NOT_FOUND({ message: "Comentario no encontrado" })`).
- Documentation keeps the language it is written in (`PRODUCT.md` is in Spanish, `README.md` in English).

### Migrations — agent hands off

**Never generate, run, push, or edit database migrations.** That is the user's job, always. Concretely, the agent must NOT:

- Run `bun run db:generate` / `bun run db:custom` / `drizzle-kit generate`
- Run `bun run db:push` / `drizzle-kit push`
- Run `bun run db:migrate` / `drizzle-kit migrate`
- Create, rename, edit, or delete anything under `packages/db/src/migrations/` (folder-per-migration format `<timestamp>_<name>/{migration.sql,snapshot.json}`)
- Edit the schema in `packages/db/src/schema/` without the user explicitly asking for that change

If a task seems to require a migration, stop and tell the user — propose the change, then wait for them to generate/push it. Read-only inspection of existing migrations is fine.

### Reuse first — search before creating a component, hook or procedure

Before writing a new React/UI component, hook, client-side helper or `packages/api` procedure, search what already exists and reuse it when it fits: `apps/frontend/src/components/ui` and `components/shared`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, the slice's own `hooks/` and `model/`, and `packages/api/src/shared` plus the feature routers. If something close exists but doesn't fit, say why. Placement rules: `stack` skill, `references/frontend/feature-structure.md` and `references/api/layering.md`.

### Process management

**Never kill, restart, or stop a running process (dev servers, `bun run dev` or `dev:local`, the Docker dev stack, backend/frontend instances, ports, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks for it in that moment.** Assume any running process is intentional and in use, even if it seems to conflict with a task (e.g. a port already in use). If a task appears blocked by a running process, stop and ask the user.

### Runtime probing (no browser automation / curl without permission)

**Never use browser automation, `curl`, `httpie`, `wget`, ad-hoc `fetch` scripts, or similar to hit the running app or API unless the user explicitly asks for it in that moment.** Most routes require auth (Better Auth session cookies); unattended probing burns tokens and time chasing 401s/redirects. Prefer `check-types` + Biome. If you need visual or runtime confirmation, ask the user for a screenshot or a pasted response.

## Validation

- Agent validation is `check-types` + Biome, plus `bun run test` (the hermetic `bun test --only-failures` suites in `packages/api`, `packages/content`, `packages/cron` and `apps/frontend`).
- Implementing includes the unit tests: a new or changed procedure, helper, hook or shared component ships with its tests in the same change (`stack` skill, `references/writing-unit-tests.md`). Live checks of `/scalar`, `/openapi.json`, `/rpc` or the UI happen only when the user explicitly asks.
- Biome 2.5.15 (root `biome.json`): 2-space indent, double quotes, no semicolons, 80-col, organize imports on, experimental HTML formatting, Tailwind CSS directives. One override: `**/*.svelte|astro|vue` disables `useConst`, `useImportType`, unused-vars/imports.
- Tailwind classes: `tailwint` (`bun run tailwind:check`).
- No ESLint, no Prettier, no Husky.

## OpenSpec workflow

This repo uses OpenSpec for spec-driven changes.

- Specs live in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`. List them with `openspec list --specs` instead of relying on a hardcoded list.
- Changes are scaffolded with `openspec new change <name>` and go through `proposal → specs + design → tasks → apply`, then the specs are synced and the change archived. Use the `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:explore`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:sync` and `/opsx:archive` commands (`.claude/commands/opsx/`), or load the matching skill (`openspec-propose`, `openspec-explore`, `openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-sync-specs`, `openspec-archive-change`) under `.claude/skills/`. The CLI is `openspec` — `openspec status --change <name> --json` and `openspec instructions <artifact> --change <name> --json` are the canonical entry points.
- `openspec/config.yaml` defines the schema as `spec-driven` and carries project context for artifact generation; keep its convention wording consistent with this file and the `stack` skill.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
