## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Server-searched record sources

A search source SHALL obtain its records through an endpoint of its own record
entity: its list endpoint when the entity is listed in full, its search endpoint
when the entity is listed in pages or its records are found by more than their
labels. A full-list source keeps the behavior of
"Searchable records of dynamic surfaces": it loads the list once while the
dialog is open and the dialog matches it locally. A server-searched source SHALL
instead ask its entity's search endpoint for the records matching the user's
text, with the same API permissions as the pages that list those records, and
SHALL list at most a fixed number of records per source in the order the
endpoint returns them. The documentation pages source SHALL be server-searched
(`documentation-reader`).

A server-searched source SHALL be queried with the text the user settled on,
about 150 ms after the last keystroke, not once per keystroke. The words of the
query that match the labels of the source's own surface or of the concrete-path
surfaces its route sits under SHALL NOT be sent to the server, while the dialog
still matches them locally against the record. The source SHALL NOT be queried
when no word remains or when what remains is shorter than two characters, and
then it SHALL list no records. While the next answer loads, the records of the
previous answer SHALL stay listed.

A record SHALL be able to carry extra match terms besides its label and
description (for example an address the server matched on, or the query words a
full-text search found in a record's body or with a typo), and the dialog
SHALL match the query against them too, so a record the endpoint returned is not
filtered out because its match is not visible in its label. The rules of
"Searchable records of dynamic surfaces" on the dialog being open, empty
queries, `adminOnly` surfaces, loading or failing sources and recent pages SHALL
apply to server-searched sources as well.

#### Scenario: A paginated source asks its own search endpoint

- **WHEN** a source is declared as server-searched and the user types "lectura"
- **THEN** the records listed for that source SHALL be the ones its entity's
  search endpoint returns for "lectura", not a page of its list endpoint

#### Scenario: Documentation pages are server-searched

- **WHEN** the user types "inversa" in the search dialog
- **THEN** the documentation pages source SHALL list what `v1.docs.search`
  returns for "inversa", in that order

#### Scenario: Server search waits for the user to pause

- **WHEN** the user types a word into the dialog one character after another
  without pausing, with a server-searched source declared
- **THEN** that source SHALL be queried for the settled text, not once per
  keystroke

#### Scenario: Section words are not sent to the server

- **WHEN** a server-searched source sits under a section labelled "Dispositivos"
  and the user types "dispositivos lectura"
- **THEN** that source SHALL be asked for "lectura" only, and the records it
  returns SHALL still match the full query in the dialog

#### Scenario: A bare section name does not query the server

- **WHEN** the user types only the label of a server-searched source's section,
  or a single character besides it
- **THEN** that source SHALL NOT be queried and SHALL list no records, while the
  section's surface still appears

#### Scenario: Results are bounded

- **WHEN** more records match than the source's limit
- **THEN** that source's group SHALL list at most that many records

#### Scenario: Extra match terms keep a server match

- **WHEN** the search endpoint returns a record because its address contains the
  typed text, and the address is one of the record's extra match terms but not
  its label or description
- **THEN** that record SHALL be listed

#### Scenario: A typo matched by the server is kept

- **WHEN** the user types "confguracion" and the documentation search returns a
  page that says "configuración"
- **THEN** that page SHALL be listed

#### Scenario: Previous answer stays while the next loads

- **WHEN** a server-searched source has listed records for one text and the user
  extends the text
- **THEN** the earlier records SHALL stay listed until the new answer arrives,
  and SHALL disappear when the text no longer qualifies for a server query

### Requirement: Searchable records

The surface search SHALL include records of dynamic surfaces. A surface whose path has a dynamic segment can declare a search source in the
application-surface registry. The source SHALL enumerate the records the
signed-in user can open on that surface, using the same API permissions as the
pages that list them. Each record SHALL become a search result whose path is the
surface's path with its dynamic segments filled from that record, or the route
the record gives, and whose label and description come from the record. The
documentation page surface SHALL list the pages of the current documentation
scope (`documentation-reader`).
Record results SHALL be shown only while the query is non-empty, SHALL be
matched case- and accent-insensitively against the record's label, description,
group label and extra match terms, and against the labels of its surface and of
the concrete-path surfaces its route sits under, and SHALL appear in a group of
their own per source with a Spanish heading. Each record result SHALL show the
icon of its surface, and its label SHALL be preceded by its trail: the labels of
the concrete-path surfaces its route sits under, or the trail the record itself
gives ("Red › DNS"). A record SHALL be able to carry an excerpt with ranges of
matched words; the result SHALL then show the excerpt in place of the
description, with those words highlighted.
A source declared on an `adminOnly` surface SHALL NOT be queried for users
without the `admin` role. Records SHALL be loaded only while the search dialog
is open, unless the source reads a query the page already holds. While they
load, or if loading fails, the static surface results SHALL still be shown and
searchable. Opening a record page SHALL NOT add it to the "Recientes" group.

#### Scenario: Finding a documentation page by title

- **WHEN** the scope is "Casa" and the user types "dns"
- **THEN** a result reading "Red › DNS" SHALL appear in the documentation
  group, and selecting it SHALL close the dialog and navigate to
  `/casa/red/dns`

#### Scenario: Excerpt replaces the description

- **WHEN** a documentation result carries an excerpt for the typed word
  "inversa"
- **THEN** the result SHALL show that excerpt under its label with "inversa"
  highlighted, and SHALL NOT show the page's description

#### Scenario: Empty query shows no records

- **WHEN** the user opens the search dialog without typing
- **THEN** no record results SHALL be listed

#### Scenario: Accent-insensitive record match

- **WHEN** a page is titled "Sincronización" and the user types
  "sincronizacion"
- **THEN** that page SHALL appear in the results

#### Scenario: Loading or failing source does not block the search

- **WHEN** a search source is still loading or its request fails
- **THEN** matching surface results SHALL still be shown, and no error SHALL
  replace the dialog content

#### Scenario: Current record is marked

- **WHEN** the user is on `/casa/red/dns` and that page appears in the results
- **THEN** that result SHALL be visually marked as the current page

#### Scenario: Record pages are not recorded as recent

- **WHEN** the user visits `/casa/red/dns` and later opens the search dialog
  without typing
- **THEN** the "Recientes" group SHALL NOT include that page

#### Scenario: Dynamic surface without a source stays out

- **WHEN** a surface with a dynamic segment declares no search source
- **THEN** neither the surface nor any of its records SHALL appear in the results
