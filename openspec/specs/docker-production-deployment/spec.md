# Docker Production Deployment

## Purpose

Defines the multi-stage production images, the registry-based and local production-like compose stacks, their healthchecks and secret handling, CI image builds and the deployment bootstrap script.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-stage production images with a cached install layer

The backend and the frontend SHALL each have a production `apps/<app>/Dockerfile` with a build stage and a runtime stage, both based on `oven/bun:${BUN_VERSION}-slim`, where `BUN_VERSION` is kept in sync with `packageManager` in the root `package.json`. The build stage SHALL set `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1`, copy the root `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `bunfig.toml` and every workspace `package.json` first, run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` with a cache mount for Bun's install cache, and only then copy the rest of the source and build the app with `NODE_ENV=production`. The build context SHALL be the repo root.

#### Scenario: Source-only change

- **WHEN** an image is rebuilt after a change under `apps/backend/src` with no manifest or lockfile change
- **THEN** the dependency install layer SHALL be reused from cache and only the source copy and build steps SHALL run again

#### Scenario: Dependency change

- **WHEN** a workspace `package.json` or `bun.lock` changes
- **THEN** the install layer SHALL be rebuilt with `--frozen-lockfile`

### Requirement: Bundled runtime without node_modules

The production builds SHALL bundle the workspace packages and every npm dependency into the app's `dist/` (tsdown for the backend, Astro/Vite with `vite.ssr.noExternal` for the frontend), and the runtime stage SHALL copy only the build output it needs, with no `node_modules`. Bun SHALL be the only runtime in the runtime image, and both the app and its compose healthcheck SHALL run on it. The runtime image SHALL set `NODE_ENV=production`.

#### Scenario: Runtime image contents

- **WHEN** the backend or frontend production image is inspected
- **THEN** it SHALL contain the app's `dist/` output and no `node_modules` directory

#### Scenario: Backend start command

- **WHEN** the backend production container starts
- **THEN** it SHALL run `bun dist/index.mjs` from `/app/apps/backend`, listening on port `3000`

### Requirement: Backend image ships migrations

The backend runtime image SHALL include the Drizzle migrations at `/app/packages/db/src/migrations`, laid out so the backend, running from `/app/apps/backend`, resolves them at `../../packages/db/src/migrations`. On startup the backend SHALL apply pending migrations and seed the admin, so a deployment needs no manual database step.

#### Scenario: First start on an empty database

- **WHEN** the production stack starts against an empty `stack` database
- **THEN** the backend SHALL apply every migration and create the admin from `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `ADMIN_NAME` before serving requests successfully

### Requirement: Frontend image runs the standalone Astro server internally

The frontend runtime image SHALL run the Astro standalone server (`bun /app/apps/frontend/dist/server/entry.mjs`) with `HOST=0.0.0.0` and `PORT=4321`, exposing port `4321` only to the Docker network (compose `expose`, never `ports`). Public build-time values SHALL be passed as build arguments (`PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`).

#### Scenario: Frontend reachable only through the gateway

- **WHEN** the production stack runs
- **THEN** the frontend SHALL answer on `frontend:4321` inside the Docker network and SHALL NOT be reachable on any host port

### Requirement: Gateway image

The gateway image (`apps/gateway/Dockerfile`) SHALL be built from `caddy:2-alpine` with `apps/gateway/Caddyfile` copied to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, SHALL expose only port `80`, and SHALL run `caddy run` with that Caddyfile. The gateway SHALL be the only service whose port is published in any production compose file.

#### Scenario: Only the gateway is published

- **WHEN** `compose.yml` or `compose.prod.yml` is inspected
- **THEN** among the app services only `gateway` SHALL declare `ports`, mapping a host port to the gateway's port `80`

### Requirement: Production compose from registry images

`compose.prod.yml`, with compose project name `stack`, SHALL run `frontend`, `backend` and `gateway` from the registry images `ghcr.io/nonetss/stack-frontend:main`, `ghcr.io/nonetss/stack-backend:main` and `ghcr.io/nonetss/stack-gateway:main`. Alongside them it SHALL run a `db` service (`postgres:17`, database `stack`, password `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from `.env`, data in the named volume `db_data`).

Containers SHALL be named `stack-<service>` and SHALL share a bridge network `stack`. The app services SHALL load `.env` through `env_file`. The backend SHALL receive `NODE_ENV=production` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` set to the `.env`'s `CORS_ORIGIN`. The frontend SHALL receive `BACKEND_URL=http://backend:3000`. The gateway SHALL publish `${FRONTEND_PORT:-4444}:80`.

#### Scenario: Starting a deployment

- **WHEN** an operator runs `docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --env-file .env up -d` in a directory holding a `.env` written by `scripts/bootstrap.sh`
- **THEN** compose SHALL pull the `stack-*` images, start `db`, `backend`, `frontend` and `gateway`, and serve the app on `FRONTEND_PORT`

#### Scenario: Data survives a redeploy

- **WHEN** the stack is recreated with newer images
- **THEN** the database data SHALL be kept in the `db_data` volume

#### Scenario: Standalone deployment directory

- **WHEN** `compose.prod.yml` is started from a directory that contains only it and `.env`
- **THEN** every service SHALL start with its full configuration, without reading any other file

### Requirement: Healthchecks, startup order and restart policy

Every service in `compose.prod.yml` SHALL declare a healthcheck and `restart: unless-stopped`; the Bun apps SHALL run with `init: true`. The backend healthcheck SHALL request `http://localhost:3000/`, the frontend healthcheck `http://localhost:4321/login`, the `db` healthcheck SHALL run `pg_isready -U postgres -d stack`, and the gateway healthcheck SHALL probe Caddy inside its own container. The backend SHALL start only after `db` is healthy and the frontend only after the backend is healthy.

#### Scenario: Database not ready yet

- **WHEN** the stack starts and Postgres is still initializing
- **THEN** the backend SHALL NOT start until the `db` healthcheck passes

#### Scenario: Crashed container

- **WHEN** the backend process exits unexpectedly
- **THEN** compose SHALL restart it

### Requirement: Local production-like compose

`compose.yml`, with compose project name `stack`, SHALL build the production images locally from the same `Dockerfile`s. It SHALL run `frontend`, `backend`, `gateway` and `db` with the same healthchecks, using the root `.env` (optional) through `env_file`. Its `db` service (`postgres:17`, database `stack`, data in the named volume `db_data`) SHALL publish no port, and the backend SHALL start only after it is healthy. The gateway SHALL publish `${FRONTEND_PORT:-4444}:80`. The backend SHALL receive `NODE_ENV=production`, a `DATABASE_URL` pointing at `db:5432/stack`, and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `CORS_ORIGIN` both set to `http://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT:-4444}`. The root scripts `docker:build`, `docker:up`, `docker:down` and `docker:logs` SHALL operate on it.

#### Scenario: Running production images locally

- **WHEN** a developer runs `bun run docker:up` without `FRONTEND_PORT` set
- **THEN** the production images SHALL be built from source, the database SHALL start in the `db` container, and the app SHALL be served through the gateway at `http://localhost:4444`

### Requirement: Secrets never baked into images

The root `.dockerignore` SHALL exclude every `.env` and `.env.*` file (except `.env.example`), `node_modules`, build outputs (`dist`, `.astro`, `.turbo`), `.git`, logs, the Dockerfiles and `compose.yml` from the build context. Runtime configuration SHALL reach containers only through compose `env_file`/`environment`, and build-time values only through build arguments carrying public values.

#### Scenario: Building with a local .env

- **WHEN** an image is built from a checkout that contains a root `.env` with real secrets
- **THEN** no layer of the image SHALL contain that `.env` or any of its values

### Requirement: CI builds only the changed images

`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` SHALL, on push to the configured branches (including `main`), determine which of the `backend`, `frontend` and `gateway` images are affected by the pushed changes and build and push only those, as a matrix. The backend and frontend SHALL be affected by changes under their app directory, `packages/`, `package.json`, `bun.lock` or `bunfig.toml`; the gateway by changes under `apps/gateway/`; and every image by changes to the workflow itself or `.dockerignore`. A new branch, a force push or a missing base commit SHALL build every image. The jobs SHALL run on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-26.04` runners. Each image SHALL be pushed to the GitHub Container Registry, authenticated with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`packages: write`), as `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>-<app>` in lowercase (for this repo `ghcr.io/nonetss/stack-<app>`) with the tags `latest`, the branch name and `<branch>-<short sha>`, using a registry layer cache per branch that falls back to `main`'s. A newer push to the same branch SHALL cancel a running build.

#### Scenario: Frontend-only change

- **WHEN** a push to `main` changes only files under `apps/frontend/`
- **THEN** CI SHALL build and push only the `stack-frontend` image, tagged `latest`, `main` and `main-<short sha>`

#### Scenario: Shared package change

- **WHEN** a push changes a file under `packages/`
- **THEN** CI SHALL rebuild both the backend and the frontend images and SHALL NOT rebuild the gateway image

#### Scenario: Nothing to build

- **WHEN** a push changes only files that affect no image
- **THEN** the build job SHALL be skipped

### Requirement: Deployment bootstrap script

`scripts/bootstrap.sh`, runnable from a clone or through `curl | bash`, SHALL generate a production `.env` in the current directory. It SHALL require `docker` (with the compose plugin), `openssl` and `curl`, read its prompts from `/dev/tty`, and refuse to run when a `.env` already exists there. It SHALL prompt for the host port (default `4444`), the public URL (default `http://localhost:<port>`), warning that Secure session cookies only work over plain `http` on `localhost`, and the admin name, email and password (at least 8 characters). After confirmation it SHALL generate `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (URL-safe hex) and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` with `openssl`, and write `FRONTEND_PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN` (the public URL), `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_URL` (pointing at `db:5432/stack`), `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_NAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, every value single-quoted, to a file created with mode `600`. It SHALL download `compose.prod.yml` from the `stack` repository when it is missing and SHALL offer to pull and start the stack.

#### Scenario: Fresh deployment

- **WHEN** an operator runs `scripts/bootstrap.sh` in an empty directory and answers the prompts
- **THEN** a mode-`600` `.env` with random secrets and the given admin credentials SHALL be written, `compose.prod.yml` SHALL be downloaded, and, if confirmed, the stack SHALL be pulled and started

#### Scenario: Existing configuration

- **WHEN** `scripts/bootstrap.sh` runs in a directory that already has a `.env`
- **THEN** it SHALL exit with an error before prompting, leaving the file unchanged

#### Scenario: Non-local plain-http URL

- **WHEN** the operator enters a public URL like `http://example.com`
- **THEN** the script SHALL warn that sign-in will fail without https and SHALL abort unless the operator confirms

### Requirement: Backend image ships git

The backend's production runtime image and its dev image SHALL include the `git` client and CA certificates, so the backend can clone and fetch the content repositories over HTTPS. The frontend and gateway images SHALL NOT need them.

#### Scenario: Cloning in a container

- **WHEN** an admin creates a content repository with an HTTPS URL the backend container's network can reach
- **THEN** the backend SHALL clone it without installing anything at runtime

### Requirement: Content reaches the backend container

`compose.yml` and `compose.prod.yml` SHALL mount a named volume `content_data` on the backend's clone root, so every content repository's clone is kept when the stack is recreated with newer images and only fetched, not cloned again, on the next boot. They SHALL mount a separate named volume `hosted_data` on the backend's hosted root, so the bare repositories of hosted content repositories, whose only copy may be the platform's, are kept when the stack is recreated. They SHALL NOT mount any host content folder in the backend container.

#### Scenario: Redeploy with a cloned repository

- **WHEN** a deployment with two content repositories is recreated with newer images
- **THEN** the backend SHALL find both clones in `content_data` and fetch them instead of cloning from scratch

#### Scenario: Redeploy with a hosted repository

- **WHEN** a deployment with the hosted repository `manual` is recreated with newer images
- **THEN** `manual`'s bare repository SHALL be found in `hosted_data` with every commit pushed before

#### Scenario: Content folder in the local production-like stack

- **WHEN** `bun run docker:up` runs with a leftover `CONTENT_DIR=../documentacion` in the root `.env`
- **THEN** no host folder SHALL be mounted in the backend container, and the backend SHALL read the repositories stored in the database
